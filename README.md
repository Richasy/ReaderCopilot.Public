## Data Collection

Developers promise not to collect users' private data and will not use this application for commercial purposes.

Reader Copilot has added AppCenter as a data telemetry tool in order to understand the usage of certain features and make targeted adjustments in the future. The collected data does not contain any personal privacy information.

The application records errors during runtime, which are usually saved in local logs. Only when encountering uncaught errors and application crashes, this data will be uploaded to AppCenter for developers to analyze.
